## How to use

Simple analysis of PocketMine plugins and libraries on GitHub Actions:

```yml
name: My PMMP Plugin Workflow
on: [ push ]
jobs:
  test-code:
    name: Run Plugin Tests
    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04 # pmmp-php-build doesn't work on ubuntu-latest yet
    steps:
      - name: Checkout source code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Run PHPStan
        uses: nxtlvlsoftware/run-phpstan-pmmp-action@v1
```

This example will run the analysis with the default settings against any code in the `src` directory. We aim to keep the
default phpstan version in-sync with whatever PocketMine is currently using, pull requests are welcome to maintain this.

Or to lock the versions of any required tools/executables to known versions:

```yml
name: My PMMP Plugin Workflow
on: [ push ]
jobs:
  test-code:
    name: Run Plugin Tests
    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04 # pmmp-php-build doesn't work on ubuntu-latest yet
    steps:
      - name: Checkout source code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: nxtlvlsoftware/run-phpstan-pmmp-action@v1
        with:
          analyse: src
          config: tests/phpstan/action.phpstan.neon
          level: 9
          php-version: 8.0.18
          phpstan-version: 1.8.2
          pmmp-version: 4.6.1
```
